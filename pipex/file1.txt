First of all read the commands. 

Argc must be 5, the name of the program plus 4 args.

first check of the infile exist and has necesary rights.
Use acces() to check if the file exists;

acces(filename, F_OK)

Use acces() to check if i can read write or exec the file

ex: acces(filename, R_OK)
ex: acces(filename, W_OK)
